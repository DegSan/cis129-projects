#This program will keep track of number os bottles collected for seven days
# calculate the amount paid out (.10 cents each)

#declare variables
totalBottles = 0
counter = 1
todayBottles = 0
totalPayout = 0
keepGoing = 'y'

#a while loop is needed to ask user for all seven days

while keepGoing == 'y':
    #code to set value of variables
    todayBottles = int(input('Enter the number of bottles returned today: '))
    totalBottles = totalBottles + todayBottles

    #code to set value of totalPayout
    totalPayout = totalPayout + todayBottles * 0.10

    #code to print the number of total bottles and total payout

    print(f'Total bottles: {totalBottles}')
    print(f'Total payout: {totalPayout:.2f}')

    #asking if user wants to enter more data
    keepGoing = input('Do you want to eneter another week worth of data? (Enter y or n: ')



#end the while statement
print('The program has ended')
