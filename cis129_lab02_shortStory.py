print("There was once a scorpion and a frog") 
print("The scorpion asked for a ride across the river on the frogs back")
print("The frog said no, as he feared of being stung") 
print("The scorpion said he would not, because if he did, they would both sink in the river")
print("The frog agreed and halfway across the river the scorpion stung the frog and they both drowned")
